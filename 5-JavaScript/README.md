# JavaScript History

## Born in Netscape (1995):

- JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich in a period of 10 days while he was working for Netscape.
- Initially it was called Mocha, but was soon renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript (in part to capitalize on the growing popularity of Java).

## Battle of the Browsers (1990s):

- During the 1990s, there was fierce competition between browsers, especially between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
- This has led to a race to implement JavaScript features and extensions quickly and effectively.

## Standardization (ECMAScript):

- To avoid fragmentation and incompatibilities between browsers, Netscape worked with ECMA International (formerly known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to standardize the language.
- This resulted in the first version of ECMAScript in 1997.

## Growth and Dominance (2000s):

- In the early 2000s, JavaScript began to be widely adopted and became a fundamental part of web development.
- Popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Prototype, and Dojo have emerged to facilitate web development.

## AJAX and Web 2.0 (Mid 2000s):

- The use of JavaScript was revolutionized with the introduction of the AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technique, which allowed specific parts of a page to be updated without having to reload the entire page.
- This drove the emergence of Web 2.0 and more interactive web applications.

## Explosion of Libraries and Frameworks (2010s):

- JavaScript has continued to grow in popularity, driven by a large community of developers and the proliferation of popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- Node.js was released in 2009, allowing JavaScript to be used for server-side development.

## ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and Beyond:

- ECMAScript 6, released in 2015, introduced many new and powerful features to the language, such as classes, arrow functions, and let/const to improve code readability and expressiveness.

## Continuous Updates:

- Since then, JavaScript has received regular updates, with new features being added with each new version of ECMAScript.

## Wide Adoption and Ubiquity (Current):

- JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages and is widely used around the world for web, mobile and even server-side development with Node.js.
- The history of JavaScript is a testament to the power of the web and how a programming language can evolve to become an essential part of modern technology.
