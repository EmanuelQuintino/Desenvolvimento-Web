      Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,
      computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
      He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
      providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
      Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
      Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.
