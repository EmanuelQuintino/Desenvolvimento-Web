## Inversion of Dependencies or IoC (Inversion of Control)

The principle of Inversion of Dependencies (IoC - Inversion of Control) is a software design that aims to invert the control of how the components of a system interact with each other. Instead of components directly controlling their dependencies, dependency inversion shifts that responsibility outside of the component. In summary, decouple business rules from infrastructure.
